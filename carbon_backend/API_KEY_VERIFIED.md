## ⚠️ Final Step: Enable Billing

The only remaining issue is **billing**. Google Maps requires billing to be enabled (even for free tier).

### **Enable Billing:**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click **"Billing"** in the left menu
3. Click **"Link a billing account"**
4. Follow the prompts to:
   - Create a billing account (if needed)
   - Add a payment method
   - Link it to your project

**Note:** 
- You get **$200 free credit per month**
- Most development usage stays within free tier
- You won't be charged unless you exceed the free credits

## 🚀 After Enabling Billing

1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for changes to take effect
2. **Restart Django server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C)
   # Then start again:
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
3. **Clear browser cache:** `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
4. **Refresh trip log page**
5. ✅ **Everything should work!**
